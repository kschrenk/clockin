# clockin

A colorful, user-friendly CLI to track working hours and vacation days locally using simple CSV files.

## Features

- Interactive setup wizard (like `create-next-app`)
- Start, pause, resume, and stop live tracking sessions
- Dynamic timer view with expected end time
- Data stored locally as CSV (easy to inspect & back up)
- Summaries (overall and weekly) with tables and color formatting
- Open raw time CSV in your default viewer
- Add vacation by number of days (supports fractional like 0.5) or by date range (skips non-working days)
- Track remaining vacation vs yearly allowance

## Installation

Clone and build locally:

```zsh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> clockin
cd clockin

# Install dependencies (uses pnpm)
pnpm install

# Build TypeScript to dist/
pnpm build

# Link globally so the `clockin` command is available
pnpm link --global
# (Or use: npm link)
```

Verify installation:

```zsh
clockin --help
```

If you see `zsh: command not found: clockin`, make sure your global pnpm bin directory is in your `$PATH`:

```zsh
export PATH="$PATH:$(pnpm bin -g)"
source ~/.zshrc
```

During development, you can run the entrypoint with tsx:

```zsh
pnpm dev -- <command> [options]
# Example
pnpm dev -- start
```

## Setup (First Run)

On first run (any command), if no config exists you will be guided through:

1. Name
2. Hours per week (**use a dot for decimals, e.g. `37.5` not `37,5`**)
3. Vacation days per year
4. Working days (default Monâ€“Fri or customize)
5. Data directory (default: `~/clockin-data`)

A summary is shown for confirmation. If you reject it, the wizard restarts.

Config file location: `~/.clockin/config.json`
Data CSV directory (default): `~/clockin-data`

To re-run setup later:

```zsh
clockin setup
```

## Usage & Commands

Run `clockin --help` or `clockin <command> --help` for details.

### Start Tracking

```zsh
clockin start [--description "Feature ABC"]
```

Starts a new session and launches a live timer. Shows current date, start time, elapsed time, expected end time. Warns if a session is already active.

### Pause / Resume

```zsh
clockin pause
clockin resume
```

Pauses or resumes the active session. Paused time is excluded from worked hours and shifts the expected end time.

### Stop

```zsh
clockin stop
```

Ends the current session, writes a row in `time-entries.csv`, and prints total worked time (minus pauses).

### Show Summary

```zsh
clockin summary           # Overall summary
clockin summary --week    # Current week summary
clockin summary --csv     # Open raw CSV in default viewer
```

### Vacation Management

Add vacation by number of working days (supports fractional days like 0.5 = half day):

```zsh
clockin vacation add <days> [start_date]
# Examples
clockin vacation add 1            # today (first working day)
clockin vacation add 0.5 2025-01-06  # half day on Jan 6, 2025
clockin vacation add 2.5 2025-01-06  # 2 full days + half on the next working day
```

If the start date is a non-working day, the next working day is used automatically.

Add vacation by date range (counts only configured working days):

```zsh
clockin vacation range <start_date> <end_date>
# Example
clockin vacation range 2025-07-01 2025-07-10
```

### Live Timer (Detached)

If you exited the live view with Ctrl+C, **your session continues running in the background**. Ctrl+C only exits the timer display, it does NOT pause tracking. To pause tracking, use:

```zsh
clockin pause
```

To resume:

```zsh
clockin resume
```

To stop and save the session:

```zsh
clockin stop
```

To reopen the timer view:

```zsh
clockin timer
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Fix                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command not found after link | Ensure global bin path is in `$PATH`; try reopening terminal   |
| Cannot start session         | Run `clockin stop` or remove `~/.clockin/current-session.json` |
| CSV opens in wrong app       | Change your OS default for `.csv` files                        |
| Wrong expected end time      | Check config via `clockin setup`                               |
| Decimal input error          | Use a dot (`.`) for decimals, e.g. `37.5` not `37,5`           |
| Ctrl+C exits timer           | Use `clockin pause` to actually pause tracking                 |
